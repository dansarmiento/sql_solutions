historical KPI separated from current KPI for data clarity
average volume per month (historical) = month volume / 12
annualized weighted average (historical) = visit volume / fiscal year total
fiscal year variance (historical) = (current FY total - previous FY total) / previous FY total
fiscal period variance (historical) = (current fiscal period total - previous fiscal period total) / previous fiscal period total

separated much for clarity, but ended up inserting the fiscal_year_target as it was simpler here
